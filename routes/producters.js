/**
 * Challenge 1:
 *
 *   - Use express.Router() to export a router called productsRouter
 *
 *    It should mount the '/api/products' and '/api/products/genres' routes.
 *    These should use the two functions from productsControllers.js: getProducts() and getGenres().
 *    Be careful here - what is the common pitfall?
 *
 *    hint.md for help!
